PAL  The disclosure is of apparatus and method for deburring the inner surface
       a metal tube by inserting a tubular structure into the metal tube and
      flowing an abrasive medium along a path over the area to be deburred and
      out of the metal tube.
GOVT
PAR  The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or
      for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without
      the payment of any royalties thereon.
PARN
PAR  This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/825,366,
      filed Jan. 24, 1992, now abandoned.
BSUM
PAC  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
PAR  In the manufacture of a weapon having a bore such as a rifle, lands are
      formed inside the barrel and it is generally necessary to remove sharp
      edges from the rifling lands at the origin of the bore. It is also
      necessary to provide the required radius of the rifling lands.
PAR  One method of removing sharp edges from rifling lands at the origin of the
      bore is known as a whipping procedure. In this procedure, emery paper is
      secured to a metal rod which is coupled to an electric drill for turning
      the rod. The rod is inserted in the barrel and the emery paper is rotated
      at the rifling land to provide the desired smoothing. This method is
      unsatisfactory because it is time consuming and does not perform the
      required radiusing of the lands.
PAC  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
PAR  The apparatus of the invention includes means for passing an abrasive fluid
      through a bore with such control that uniform smoothing of lands and
      uniform radiusing are achieved.

PAR  The drawing is a side sectional elevational view of apparatus embodying the
      invention.
DETD
PAC  DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
PAR  The apparatus of the invention is used to smooth burrs on rifling lands 10
      and to radius the lands in the origin of the bore 20 of a rifle or similar
      weapon 30. The deburring apparatus 40 is a tubular member which includes
      an annular outer tube 50 and a central tube 60 and is adapted to be
      inserted into the bore of the weapon to be deburred and radiused. The
      terms "radius" is used occasionally as a verb throughout this application,
      as in "to radius" a tube, or "radiusing" e.g. The meaning is to smoothly
      round sharp edges here for example in a precision way, to a particular
      (diameter) radius. The application given here is to smooth out the sharp
      edges of a rifling pattern (like internal threads) cut into the bore of a
      weapon. The space 230 between outer tube 50 and central tube 60 provides a
      path for a fluid medium as will be explained below. The deburring
      apparatus has a front end 70 and a rear end 80.
PAR  The rear end 80 of the deburring apparatus 40 which is adapted to be
      positioned adjacent to the rifling lands to be radiused includes a first
      annular wall and mechanical seal 90 at which the outer annular tube 50
      terminates and through which the inner central tube 60 passes. The
      mechanical seal 90 includes a plurality of apertures 100 which are in
      communication with the outer annular tube 50. The mechanical seal wall or
      connector 90 includes an annular sealing ring 95 secured to its rear
      surface. The sealing ring has a diameter such that it fits snugly in the
      powder chamber 25 of the weapon.
PAR  Spaced from the mechanical seal 90 is a front seal assembly which includes
      second annular wall or plate 110, of a diameter to fit snugly in the
      weapon bore. The front seal assembly also includes an annular gasket 115
      disposed against the surface of plate 110 which faces wall 90.
PAR  Between the first and second walls 90 and 110 is placed a part 120 known as
      a medium compression head. This compression head is generally annular and
      includes a central bore into which the central tube 60 extends in a tight
      fit. The annular member 120 has a central portion 121 of a diameter such
      that its outer wall 130 is disposed suitably close to the wall of the
      weapon bore at the rifling lands 10 to be radiused. The annular member or
      compression head 120 includes a first annular portion 121 and a second
      annular portion 150 on either side thereof. The first annular portion 121
      is spaced a small distance from the seal wall 90 and the second annular
      portion 150 bears against the seal wall or plate 110. Where the central
      portion 121 of annular member 120 meets the second annular portion 150, it
      is provided with a plurality of apertures 160 arrayed in an annular
      pattern which communicate with the bore of the annular member 120 and the
      central tube 60. The annular portion 121 is sealed to the central tube 60
      by a sealing means 195.
PAR  In operation of the deburring apparatus 40, the apparatus 40 is inserted in
      the bore of the weapon having rifling lands to be deburred and radiused
      with the central portion 121 of the annular member 120 disposed at the
      rifling lands. The apparatus 40 is supported and centered by annular
      guides 170 disposed along its length, as required. A source 180 of an
      abrading medium comprised of a carbide silicone based material impregnated
      with various size grains of carbide chips is provided and is coupled by
      suitable hosing to the quick release connector 175 secured to annular
      outer tube 50 and the central tube 60 so that the medium can flow into the
      central tube. Suitable hosing is also connected to a quick release
      connector 190 provided on central tube 60. The fluid medium flows, under
      pressure, down the annular tube 50, through the apertures 100 in the wall
      90 along the outer surface 130 of the annular member 120 and across the
      rifling lands 10 and through the apertures 160 in the second annular 150
      and into the central tube 60 and out 190, thereafter back to the source
      180 of the fluid medium (fluid recycling recovery mechanism not shown).
      This operation is continued until the rifling lands are properly radiused.
      Normally, this operation can be completed in a time of the order of four
      to six hours.
PAR  All parts of the deburring apparatus 40 are preferably of aluminum except
      for certain parts which are of hardened steel where required. The annular
      compression head 120 is treated to a 0.0005 hardcoating. A plate 185
      serves to support the deburring apparatus in general, and further serves
      to support the apparatus for insertion into the tube for the deburring
      operation.
